#Introduction
intro = """Welcome to our Income Taxes Simulation. By Phillip Yan, Matthew Cheng, and John Zammit \n
This program will help you understand how income taxes work on both a micro and a macro level. 
As an individual, the program will help you calculate the amount of tax you need to pay based on your income, and also 
calculate the average rate of the tax. 
At the same time, in this simulation, you'll be able to understand how differences between income tax structures impact 
both the individual's pocketbook and productivity within the economy as a whole, with concepts like the Laffer Curve"""

Income tax brackets are usually expressed in terms of marginal tax rates, or the tax rate at which a certain bracket of income is taxed. This can be quite hassle for the average american who is looking to file taxes. 
While it isn't a complete guide to the deductions, caveats and exceptions of byzantine income tax systems, the average tax is usually a better function to use when calculating the amount of tax to pay in taxes.
